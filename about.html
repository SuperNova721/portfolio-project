          <h1>Hi, I am Holly Hadley</h1>
          <h3 class="mt-2">Front-end Developer based in Bonney Lake, WA</h3>
          <p class="mt-5">
            A little about myself, I am a creative individual with a passion for
            learning and teaching. I was a Teacher/Interventionist for a
            non-for-profit Relief Nursery, Family Building Blocks, located in
            Salem, OR. I was an infant/toddler/preschool teacher for alomst
            eight years before being promoted to Classroom Supervisor. Since
            leaving the teaching field, I started my own side career where I
            created and ran a success home floral business, Daphne & June LLC.
            After a year running my own business, I decided I wanted to explore
            a full-time career path, one that would provide a challenging,
            stable and rewarding future. I enrolled in an online bootcamp called
            SheCodes, and quickly developed a passion for coding. When I am not
            coding, I am usually creating or building projects around my home,
            or spending time with friends and family or playing with my
            hilarious Dog, Nova. I am someone who constantly seeks out new
            challenges in life and enjoys doing things that are unexpected,
            especially as a woman. Whether its learning to ride a motorcycle,
            start my own business or coding. I value growth and keeping myself
            curious. I love to push myself to do hard things.
